# Using the comment-summary-in-pr you can get the results of the action in the PR as a comment. In order for this to work, the action needs to be able to create a comment in the PR. This requires additional pull-requests: write permission.

# Using the allow-dependencies-licenses you can exclude dependencies from the license check.
# The values should be provided in purl format. In this example, we are excluding lodash from npm from the license check
